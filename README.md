# Visualizing CNN Filters with VGG16 using TensorFlow and Google Colab

## Project Overview

Welcome to this short project where we will leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by utilizing the popular VGG16 model. Our main goal is to visualize different filters from various layers of the CNN using gradient ascent. This technique allows us to generate images that maximally activate specific filters, providing insights into what the network has learned.

## Technologies Used

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** We will be working with the VGG16 model.
- **TensorFlow:** Our machine learning framework for building and training the CNN.
- **Google Colab:** This project is hosted on Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment. Colab provides free access to GPUs, enhancing the performance of our notebooks.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Experience in Python:** Participants are expected to have prior programming experience in Python.
- **Theoretical Understanding:** A foundational understanding of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and optimization algorithms like gradient descent is recommended. This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation using TensorFlow.

## Project Structure

The project is designed to be completed within a 1-hour timeframe. It will consist of the following key steps:

1. **Introduction to VGG16:** Brief overview of the VGG16 model and its significance in computer vision.
2. **Loading and Preprocessing Data:** Utilizing TensorFlow to load and preprocess data for training.
3. **Building the VGG16 Model:** Constructing the CNN architecture using the VGG16 model.
4. **Gradient Ascent for Visualization:** Understanding and implementing gradient ascent to visualize filters from different layers.
5. **Running the Notebook on Google Colab:** Participants will run the Jupyter Notebook in the Google Colab environment, taking advantage of its GPU capabilities.
